# FantasyCardGame

Game Setup
```
Cards are shuffled each player draw 5 cards
```
How it works ?
```
Each card represents an individual of a race.
Each race has a specific power.
Each player draws a card and plays a card from his/her hand in front of him/her.
Then he/she applies the power of the card.
The cards in front of a player compose his/her kingdom.
Then it's the turn of the next player.
```
End of the game

```
The game continues even if the deck is empty until one of the players plays his/her last card.
Then the other player play his/her last turn.
So each players have played the same number of cards during the game.
Each player receive 1 point for each individual within its kingdom.
He/She also receive 3 extra point if he/she has almost one individual of each of the 6 races.
```
